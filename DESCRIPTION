Description: Performs robust multiple testing for means in the presence of known and unknown latent factors.
             It implements a robust procedure to estimate distribution parameters using the Huber's loss function and accounts for strong dependence among coordinates via an approximate factor model. 
             This method is particularly suitable for high-dimensional data when there are many variables but only a small number of observations available. 
             Moreover, the method is tailored to cases when the underlying distribution far deviates from Gaussianity, which is commonly assumed in the literature.
