Title: Factor Adjusted Robust Multiple Testing
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Koushiki", "Bose", email = "bose@princeton.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Performs robust multiple testing for means in the presence of known and unknown latent factors.
             This package is especially suited to high-dimensional, heavy-tailed datasets, where the user suspects there might be some underlying latent factors. 
             The Huber's loss function is used in place of the usual least-squares loss to robustly estimate parameters.
