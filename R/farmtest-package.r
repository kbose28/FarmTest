#' FarmTest: Factor Adjusted Robust Multiple Testing
#'
#' This R package conducts multiple hypothesis testing of mean effects. It implements a robust procedure to estimate distribution parameters and accounts for strong dependence among coordinates via an approximate factor model. This method is particularly suitable for high-dimensional data when there are thousands of variables but only a small number of observations available. Moreover, the method is tailored to cases when the underlying distribution deviates from Gaussianity, which is commonly assumed in the literature.
